# Remembrall

---
Yet another TODO List App, but highly `Opinionated`.

## Installation
```bash
make build
```
This will build your os specific binary in the `./bin/remembrall`

## Actions

**Get All tasks**
```bash
./bin/remembrall task
```

**Add a tasks**
```bash
./bin/remembrall task add
```

**Remove a tasks**
```bash
./bin/remembrall task rm
```

__All the task will be automaticaly synced in the cloud. I choose self-hosted `Minio` for that.__

## Road Map
- Robust Notification
- x-platform app
